Certainly! Here are the responses to the advanced-level Python problems based on tuples:

1. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted by the sum of their elements.

```python
def sort_tuples_by_sum(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda t: sum(t))
```

2. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted by the product of their elements.

```python
def sort_tuples_by_product(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda t: reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, t))
```

3. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted by the number of distinct elements they contain.

```python
def sort_tuples_by_distinct_elements(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda t: len(set(t)))
```

4. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing only the tuples that are subsets of at least one other tuple in the list.

```python
def find_subset_tuples(tuple_list):
    return [t for t in tuple_list if any(set(t).issubset(set(x)) for x in tuple_list if x != t)]
```

5. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples with elements in ascending order within each tuple.

```python
def sort_elements_in_tuples_ascending(tuple_list):
    return [tuple(sorted(t)) for t in tuple_list]
```

6. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples with elements in descending order within each tuple.

```python
def sort_elements_in_tuples_descending(tuple_list):
    return [tuple(sorted(t, reverse=True)) for t in tuple_list]
```

7. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples with elements sorted in order, with numbers first followed by strings.

```python
def sort_elements_in_tuples(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda t: (any(isinstance(e, int) for e in t), t))
```

8. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples with elements sorted by their absolute values.

```python
def sort_elements_by_absolute_value(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda t: tuple(abs(e) for e in t))
```

9. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted in reverse order.

```python
def sort_tuples_in_reverse(tuple_list):
    return sorted(tuple_list, reverse=True)
```

10. Problem: Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted based on a custom sorting criteria defined by a comparison function.

```python
def sort_tuples_with_custom_criteria(tuple_list, comparison_function):
    return sorted(tuple_list, key=comparison_function)
```

These are the solutions to the advanced-level problems based on tuples. You can use these functions to solve the respective tasks.
